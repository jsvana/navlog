# navlog

`navlog` is a small set of utilities useful to Citabria 7ECA pilots. With some work it could be made useful to others.

This is a work in progress, and should never be used in place of proper pilotage, dead reckoning, or GPS navigation. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

    $ python -m navlog --help

then choose the functionality you want.

## Motivation

Writing VFR navlogs is a pain, so I made it less of one.
